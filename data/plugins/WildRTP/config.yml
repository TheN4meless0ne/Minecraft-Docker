# by Joni - Thank you for using this plugin

# Set the language
# available [en_EN, de_DE, fr_FR] you can add or edit languages in the plugin folder / lang
lang: "en_EN"

# Settings for the RTP
# available algorithms [CIRCLE, SQUARE]
teleport:
  min: 1000
  max: 2500
  algorithm: CIRCLE
  center:
    player: false
    x: 0
    z: 0

# AutoRTP
# Should WildRTP teleport a player automatically when he firstjoins, just joins or dies
auto:
  onfirstjoin: false
  onjoin: false
  ondeath: false

# Blacklist
# Disable worlds, so the player can't execute the command there
# for example: - world_nether
blacklist:
  #- world1

# Whitelist
# allow teleportation only in whitelisted worlds
# overrides blacklist
whitelist-enabled: false
whitelist:
  #- world1

# Titles
# in seconds
# When RTP starts to generate a safe location the start title will be displayed. However on good servers the algorithm is very fast and it can happen that the title is never shown.
# When a safe location has been found and the player has been teleported then the end title is shown.
titles:
  start:
    enabled: false
    fadeIn: 0.5
    stay: 2
    fadeOut: 0.5
  end:
    enabled: true
    fadeIn: 0.5
    stay: 2
    fadeOut: 0.5

# Should WildRTP send messages when RTP starts to generate a safe location or when a safe location has been found and the player has been teleported
messages:
  start: false
  end: true

# Cooldown
# Set up a cooldown, so players can't spam the command and decrease the performance
# The time is in seconds
# If you want to have custom cooldowns depending on their permission enable custom and enter the group under custom
cooldown:
  enabled: true
  custom: false
  time: 30

# In order to get custom cooldowns to work, you have to enter a group here, just like the comments under the section custom, just remove # before the group and the cooldown and rename it
# and set it up as you want. This might be glitchy! Then you only need to give the player / group the permission wildrtp.cooldown.custom.yourgroup
custom:
  example1:
    cooldown: 15

# Movetimer
# also known as combat timer / pvp timer
# If enabled, players need to stand still and don't move in order to be teleported.
movetimer:
  enabled: true
  time: 5
